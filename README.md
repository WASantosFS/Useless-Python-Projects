# Useless Python Projects
## Scope
The purpose of this is to reinforce what I have been learning on PluralSight's "Core Python" path. I noticed when I has over 60% of the way through that I was essentially learning on an academic level, without homework or doing projects. This is an effort to correct this.

These projects are from the "Impractical Python Projects" book. The goal, ultimately, is to go through the entire book, but also to complete additional 'side' projects that are off-shoots that may interest me.
